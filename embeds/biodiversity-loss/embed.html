A holistic program including restoring fertility to the farm land (no chemicals used), improved health and education facilities, water management programs, microcredit opportunities (particularly for women), family planning information, and scholarships to keep girls in school. Today this operates in 72 villages throughout the range of Tanzania’s remaining chimpanzees, most of whom live in unprotected village forest reserves. Village volunteers learn to use smart phones, patrol their forests, and note any illegal activities as well as signs or sighting of animals. This information is uploaded onto a platform in the cloud, including Global Forest Watch.</p><p>Tacare now operates similar programmes in six other African countries. “The villagers have become our partners in conservation,” says Goodall. “They know that protecting the environment benefits them as well as wildlife.”</p></div></div><script src="//j.ophan.co.uk/interactive.js"></script><script src="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/libs/iframe-messenger/iframeMessenger.js"></script><script>iframeMessenger.enableAutoResize();</script></body></html>
