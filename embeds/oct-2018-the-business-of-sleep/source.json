  "description": "As sleep patterns come unstuck and more and more people complain of not getting enough shuteye, so businesses have spotted an opportunity. The entire market for sleep aids – everything from ergonomic mattresses to biomonitors, sleeping draughts, apnea devices and medication – is predicted to top $80bn by 2020.</p><p>There is, however, little science behind many of the products on the market. Comfortable bedding tends to make good sleepers sleep better, but won’t crack insomnia. Medication is a short-term solution to deal with acute conditions, but should not be used for more than a few weeks at a time.</p><p>And beware any consumer product which claims it will transform your slumber: it’s probably a load of Horlicks."
