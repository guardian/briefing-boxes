  "description": "The bottomless pit of information we call the internet is a mixed blessing. As much as the internet spreads knowledge and understanding around the world, it also provides endless opportunities to waste time and develop unhealthy habits, such as obsessively checking social media. Research has linked excessive Facebook use with low self-esteem and poor life satisfaction, though cause and effect are hard to nail down. Twitter, which Amnesty International accuse of having created a toxic environment for women, asked for help in March in curbing trolls and misinformation. Meanwhile, doctors warn against taking tablets and mobile phones into the bedroom because of the sleep-disrupting impact of screens.<br /><br />The ills of online life have forced some to turn their back on the internet, or at least the most time-draining, abusive, and addictive services. If Ofcom data is right, that could free up a whole lot of life. The watchdog found that the average Briton checks their mobile phone once every 12 seconds and spends a full 24 hours per week online, with some racking up a staggering 40 hours."
